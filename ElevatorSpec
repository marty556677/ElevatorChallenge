Elevator Simulator Specification

Configurable items (config.properties):
    numberOfFloors: the starting number of floors in the building.
    numberOfElevators: the starting number of elevators in the building.
    numberOfPeople: the starting number of people.
    cycleDelayInMilliseconds: the milliseconds delay for each iteration of the main cycle loop, used to slow the simulation down to mimic reality.
    detailedLogging: true/false, used to trigger detailed console logging that shows the progress of the simulation.

Start State:
    Each person starts on a random floor, with a random target floor.
    Each elevator starts in an idle state on a random floor.
    Each person calls to their floor in the direction they want to go, taking turns based on their initial index. It happens outside the main loop.

End State:
    The simulator ends when all people have attained their target floor.

Things that could be improved:
    1. A UI that shows the progress of the simulator rather then using the console.
    2. Along with the UI, a way to input the configurable items from the user.
    3. Implement a way to delay the floor calling that happens in the initial setup, to more closely mimic reality.
    4. Add maximum capacity handling for elevators.
    5. Add subtypes to the elevators or people that could add special properties that would somehow change the basic functionality.
